## Cocktail Search app

My goal with this project was to simulate a professional work environment.
This time I was focusing on the frontend and decided to use an existing API.

* I built this app using [https://figma.com](Figma) designs
* I worked with tasks using [ec2-13-51-252-148.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com/](Issue Tracker)
* I used feature branches

## What I have learned

* Using ESLint Javascript linter

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
